# 3DP-VR
## A VERY SIMPLE 3D-printed VR headset for smartphone-compatible VR content.

This project isn't that serious, and I'm only putting it here for documentation purposes.

### Currently available in only one size: 
68mm eye gap


### Lens specs:
50mm approx. focal length,
36.6mm diameter (circular)


### Assembly:
1. Press-fit the lenses into the circular holes.
2. Use two rubber bands to secure a smartphone on the open side.
